/**
 * Elastic, multi-tier orchestration for the agent-company model (Requirement 3,
 * criteria 3.1, 3.2 and 3.12).
 *
 * ## Role mapping (criterion 3.2)
 *
 * The company organises agents into a role tree that scales with project size:
 *
 * ```
 *   President            (receives the goal, represents the company to the user)
 *     └─ Division head    (per "mảng": Frontend, Backend, ...)
 *          └─ Worker      ("tay chân" — executes a concrete task, then exits)
 * ```
 *
 * Onto the existing Team Mode (Leader ↔ Teammate, see `teams` / `mailbox` /
 * `team_tasks` and the `ipcBridge.team.*` → `/api/teams/*` surface) this maps as:
 *
 * - **President ≈ Team Leader** (`TeammateRole = 'leader'`).
 * - **Division head ≈ Teammate** in a managing role.
 * - **Worker ≈ Teammate** in an executing role.
 *
 * ## ⚠️ FLATTEN simulation (the one architectural compromise)
 *
 * Team Mode is **only 2-level** today — `TeammateRole` is literally
 * `'leader' | 'teammate'` (`common/types/team/teamTypes.ts`), and the team API
 * exposes a single Leader plus a flat pool of Teammates. There is no native
 * notion of a Teammate that itself manages other Teammates.
 *
 * This orchestrator therefore keeps the **role tree** (arbitrarily deep) in the
 * Main process, but **spawns every executing agent FLAT** as a Team Mode
 * Teammate under one Leader. The managerial layers (division heads) are
 * *simulated*: instead of spawning a live head agent that re-delegates, the head's
 * division context is composed into each worker's briefing via
 * {@link ContextLayering.buildDelegationContext}. Every place that performs this
 * flattening is marked with an `// FLATTEN:` comment so it can be upgraded to
 * real nesting if/when tomnycore grows a multi-level team API (see the "CẦN
 * BACKEND" note in `design.md`, Yêu cầu 3).
 *
 * ## Concurrency (criterion 3.12)
 *
 * The number of agents running in parallel is **not** decided here — it is
 * governed by the {@link IResourceCoordinator}. Before spawning each agent the
 * orchestrator awaits `requestLease({ kind: 'agent', estCostMB })`; that call
 * blocks (queues) until the coordinator's budget has room, so parallelism is a
 * pure function of free RAM. The lease is released when the agent finishes. A
 * hardcoded fallback limiter is used **only** when no coordinator is injected
 * (see {@link FALLBACK_MAX_PARALLEL_AGENTS}); production wiring always passes the
 * real coordinator.
 *
 * ## Testability
 *
 * Every heavy collaborator is injected (see {@link CompanyOrchestratorDeps}) so
 * the orchestrator can be unit-tested without tomnycore, a live CLI, or disk:
 * the memory store, the context-layering service, the call-template manager, the
 * resource coordinator, and the {@link TeamGateway} that abstracts the team RPC.
 *
 * Process boundary: Main-process (Node.js) service. No DOM APIs.
