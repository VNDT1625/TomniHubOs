/**
 * Layered context for the agent-company model (Requirement 3 — "Mô hình công ty
 * tác nhân", criteria 3.8 and 3.9).
 *
 * Context is split into two composable layers:
 *
 * 1. **Company-wide shared layer** ({@link CompanyContext}) — common rules and a
 *    handful of shared items that every agent in the company can see
 *    (criterion 3.8, first half).
 * 2. **Per-division layer** ({@link DivisionContext}) — context owned/held by the
 *    head of a division ("mảng", e.g. Frontend, Backend). Only the division and
 *    its head carry this context (criterion 3.8, second half).
 *
 * When a superior delegates work *down* to a worker ("tay chân") agent, the
 * division's context is composed together with the company layer and the task
 * prompt, then handed to the worker as a single payload (criterion 3.9). The
 * payload is modelled on the existing Team-Mode **`mailbox`** message (see the
 * `mailbox` table in `docs/CODEBASE_GUIDE.md` §19) so it can be passed through
 * the same async messaging channel used by Team Mode.
 *
 * Invariant — workers hold no private memory: {@link ContextLayering} stores
 * **no per-worker / per-agent state whatsoever**. Worker context exists only at
 * delegation time, inside the value returned by {@link ContextLayering.buildDelegationContext}.
 * That method is a pure function of the company layer, the addressed division
 * layer, and the request; it performs no writes and keeps nothing keyed by the
 * receiving agent. This is what Property 7 (task 4.5) validates.
 *
 * Process boundary: this is a Main-process (Node.js) module. It uses no DOM APIs
 * and intentionally has **no imports** from sibling company services
 * (`memoryStore.ts`, `callTemplate.ts`) so it stays independent while those are
 * built in parallel — any memory type it needs is defined locally below.
