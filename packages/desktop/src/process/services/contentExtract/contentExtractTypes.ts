 * The service turns three kinds of source — a YouTube video, a local file
 * (PDF/Word/PPT/Excel/…), or raw HTML — into clean **Markdown/text** that any
 * AI surface (Browser web-agent, Studio chat, IDE, Manager, Make Video, Testing)
 * can feed to a model. Centralising it means every surface gets the same
 * high-quality extraction (yt-dlp → fallback for transcripts; markitdown →
 * Node fallback for files) instead of each re-implementing a weaker version.
 *
 * Process boundary: Main-process (Node.js) modules. No DOM APIs.
