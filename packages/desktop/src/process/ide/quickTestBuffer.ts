/**
 * `quickTestBuffer` — the shared rolling-buffer policy for both Quick Test
 * tracers (web/CDP and native/log-stream).
 *
 * ## Why a smart buffer
 *
 * A naive `events.shift()` cap drops the OLDEST event whenever the buffer is
 * full. In a real app that is exactly wrong: a chatty page emits dozens of
 * `console.log`s and `2xx` network responses per second, so a blind cap quickly
 * evicts the very click that triggered the bug — and even the error itself —
 * leaving the agent a trace with no signal.
 *
 * {@link pushBounded} fixes this by evicting the oldest **low-value** event
 * (routine logs / successful responses) first, and only falling back to the
 * oldest event when everything in the window is significant. The result: the
 * error and the interaction path that led to it survive even under heavy log
 * pressure, while memory stays bounded.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free (type-only import of {@link TraceEvent}, erased at
 * runtime — no circular dependency with `quickTestTracer`). Shared module.
 */

 * Max events kept in a tracer's rolling buffer. Sized so the full interaction
 * path to an error survives a noisy app, while staying tiny in memory (a few

 * request that failed — either a 4xx/5xx response OR a transport failure

 * so the web + native tracers and the service pick the SAME error precedence
 * (single source of truth for {@link findFirstError} and the tracers' `hasError`
 * flag).
