/**
 * PURE in-chat stale detector (mechanism c).
 *
 * After RTK grounds a model with a fact, this decides whether the fact should be
 * re-verified before being relied upon — because its TTL lapsed, or because the
 * conversation surfaced evidence that contradicts it (or the user doubted it).
 * The decision is a pure function of the fact's freshness plus a few boolean
 * conversation signals, so it is deterministic and trivially testable. The
 * actual verification (network) is the caller's job.
 *
 * Policy: fresh contradicting evidence always triggers verification (new
 * evidence trumps a still-valid TTL); an expired fact always triggers it; a
 * merely stale fact triggers it only when something in the chat casts doubt.
 *
 * No I/O, no Node/DOM APIs.
