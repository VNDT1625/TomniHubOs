 * Before any value is overwritten, the candidate must clear an evidence bar:
 * enough independent sources, agreement between them, and (when the value
 * actually changes) corroboration that the new value is the one the sources
 * support. The decision is PURE — it scores already-gathered evidence and
 * returns `accept` / `reject` / `review` — so the policy is deterministic and
 * unit-testable. Actually applying the decision (writing the fact + history) is
 * the caller's job.
 *
 * The rule is deliberately conservative: a model "thinking" a value changed is
 * NOT evidence; only fetched sources count.
