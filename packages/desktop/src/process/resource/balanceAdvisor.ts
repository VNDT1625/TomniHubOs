/**
 * Tier C of the ResourceCoordinator's balancing strategy (Requirement 5 —
 * anti-lag resource management, "bậc c — AI phân tích sâu"; criteria 5.6 / 5.8).
 *
 * Tier A (`balancePolicy.suggestPreset` / `presetBudget`) picks a starting
 * budget from the static machine profile, and Tier B
 * (`balancePolicy.evaluateAdjustment`) nudges that budget up and down with
 * rule-based hysteresis while the machine runs. When the machine **still** lags
 * after several Tier B cycles — i.e. the rule engine could not relieve the
 * pressure (it is pinned at the concurrency floor, or its small steps are not
 * enough) — this module escalates to an AI agent for a deeper, holistic look.
 *
 * The flow this module implements:
 *
 * 1. {@link shouldEscalate} — a **pure** predicate the coordinator calls to
 *    decide whether Tier C should trigger at all (persistent lag across
 *    {@link DEFAULT_ESCALATION_CYCLES} sampling cycles).
 * 2. {@link buildAnalysisPrompt} — a **pure** builder that packages the current
 *    {@link ResourceState} (machine profile, budget, recent pressure samples,
 *    and the `lastAdjustments` history with their reasons) into a prompt asking
 *    the agent for a new budget.
 * 3. {@link createBalanceAdvisor} — the advisor itself. It calls the injected
 *    {@link AskAgent}, robustly parses the proposed budget out of the (possibly
 *    messy) agent response, validates and clamps it to sane bounds, and returns
 *    a ready-to-apply {@link BudgetAdjustment} (or `null` when nothing should
 *    change or the response could not be parsed).
 *
 * ## Design decisions
 *
 * - **The advisor never persists and never applies.** It returns a
 *   {@link BudgetAdjustment}; the *coordinator* applies it through its existing
 *   path (`appendBudgetAdjustment`, criterion 5.8), so the `reason` is recorded
 *   exactly like a Tier B adjustment. This keeps the advisor free of file-system
 *   side effects and avoids an import cycle with `resourceCoordinator.ts` — this
 *   module depends only on the shared types and the policy constants.
 * - **The agent call is injected** (`askAgent`) rather than hard-wiring a
 *   specific tomnycore conversation. That keeps the module trivially mockable and
 *   lets the real wiring (a temporary tomnycore conversation, a cheap model, …)
 *   be plugged in later by the integration task without touching this file.
 * - **The model call is heavy and must itself be lease-gated.** Because the
 *   advisor deliberately does not import the coordinator, **the caller
 *   (coordinator) is responsible for `requestLease` / `releaseLease`** around
 *   the `askAgent` invocation. This module assumes the lease has already been
 *   granted by the time {@link BalanceAdvisor.analyze} is called.
 * - **Never throws on a bad response.** A failed agent call, an empty reply, or
 *   unparseable text all resolve to `null` (with a warning logged) so a flaky
 *   model can never crash the balancing loop.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * {@link shouldEscalate} and {@link buildAnalysisPrompt} are pure (no clock, no
 * IO). The advisor's only impurity is the injected `askAgent` and an injectable
 * `now` clock, mirroring the rest of the resource module's testability strategy.
