 * - `browser`       — an embedded browser (WebContentsView) tab
 * - `emulator`      — an Android emulator instance
 * - `windowsTest`   — a Windows .exe test session in a virtual display
 * - `patchBuild`    — building and testing a candidate bug-fix patch
 * - `ocr`           — optical character recognition of scanned documents
 * - `transcription` — audio/video speech-to-text
 * - `docConvert`    — document conversion (e.g. PDF ⇄ Word)
 * - `semanticIndex` — embedding / vector index work for semantic tool selection
