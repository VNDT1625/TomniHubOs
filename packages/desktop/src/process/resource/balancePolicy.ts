/**
 * Balancing policy for the ResourceCoordinator (Requirement 5 — anti-lag
 * resource management). This module is the rule engine behind the first two of
 * the "three tiers" of balancing described in `design.md` (Yêu cầu 5):
 *
 * - **Tier A — initial assessment (bậc a, criterion 5.3 / 5.6):** given the
 *   static {@link MachineProfile} read by `systemProbe`, derive a *suggested*
 *   preset (`saver | balanced | performance`) and turn any preset into a
 *   concrete {@link ResourceBudget}.
 * - **Tier B — real-time self-adjust (bậc b, criteria 5.6 / 5.7):** given the
 *   current budget plus a live sample of resource pressure, decide whether to
 *   scale the budget down (machine under load) or back up (machine comfortable)
 *   and return a human-readable `reason`. Implements **hysteresis** (a dead-band
 *   between the scale-down and scale-up thresholds so it never flaps around a
 *   single point) and **rate limiting** (at most {@link MAX_ADJUSTMENTS_PER_WINDOW}
 *   adjustments per {@link RATE_LIMIT_WINDOW_MS}).
 *
 * Tier C (bậc c — AI deep analysis) lives in `balanceAdvisor.ts` and is out of
 * scope here.
 *
 * ## Purity
 *
 * Every function in this module is **pure**: it never reads the clock, the file
 * system, or the machine directly. The current time (`now`), the live resource
 * sample, and the recent-adjustment timestamps are all passed in as parameters.
 * This keeps the policy trivially unit-testable (subtask 1.5) and lets the
 * coordinator (subtask 1.6) own all the side effects (timers, probes, and
 * persistence via `appendBudgetAdjustment`).
