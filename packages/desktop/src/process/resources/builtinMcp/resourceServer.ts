/**
 * Built-in MCP server for resource status (Requirement 5.9 — Agent plane).
 *
 * Runs as a standalone stdio process spawned by the MCP client, mirroring
 * `imageGenServer.ts`. It exposes a single **read-only** tool so an agent can
 * see whether the host machine is under load and self-throttle.
 *
 * Important boundary: this tool only *reports* the coordinator's state. It does
 * NOT request or grant leases and never mutates anything — leasing stays an
 * internal-service responsibility (design note: "việc xin lease vẫn do service
 * nội bộ làm"; agents do not allocate resources to themselves).
 *
 * Because this server boots in a separate `node` process (not the Electron Main
 * process), it cannot reach the live {@link IResourceCoordinator} singleton or
 * Electron's `app.getPath`. Instead it reads the persisted `resource-state.json`
 * the coordinator writes — the cross-process source of truth — from the
 * directory passed via {@link RESOURCE_STATE_DIR_ENV_KEY}. This keeps the
 * bundle free of Electron/storage side effects, matching the standalone pattern
 * established by the image-gen server.

Use this BEFORE starting any heavy work (spawning extra agents, opening browser tabs, running tests, transcription, document conversion, semantic indexing, etc.) to check whether the machine is under load, then self-throttle accordingly.

Returns a JSON summary plus a short text assessment:
- machine: total RAM (MB), CPU cores, discrete GPU presence, free disk (MB)
- mode: "detailed" (user-managed) or "suggest" (auto-balancing)
- preset: "saver" | "balanced" | "performance" | "custom"
- budget: per-task-kind concurrency limits + total heavy-task memory ceiling + RAM reserved for the user
- activeLeaseCount / activeByKind: how many heavy tasks are currently running, by kind
- queuedCount: tasks waiting because the budget is exhausted
- activeMemoryMB: estimated RAM held by running heavy tasks (compare against budget.maxTotalMemoryMB)
- recentAdjustmentReasons: why the coordinator recently rescaled the budget

This tool takes NO input and CANNOT change anything. It does not request or grant leases — resource leasing is performed by internal services on the agent's behalf; an agent never allocates resources to itself.`,
