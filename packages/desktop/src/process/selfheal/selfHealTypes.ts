/**
 * Shared types for the self-heal layer — the deterministic "Tier 0" companion to
 * the AI-backed monitor (`process/monitor`).
 *
 * Tier 0 handles errors that have a KNOWN, rule-based root cause and a KNOWN fix
 * that needs no model: a missing npm dependency, an icon imported under a name
 * the icon library does not export, a locale file/key missing versus the base
 * language, a lazy route whose module file does not exist. Each detector returns
 * a {@link SelfHealFinding} carrying both the diagnosis and a concrete,
 * machine-applicable {@link SelfHealFix}.
 *
 * Anything a rule cannot diagnose deterministically is left for Tier 1 (the
 * model-backed `rootCauseAnalyzer`); see {@link SelfHealTier}.
 *
 * Process boundary: Main-process (Node.js) types only — no DOM, no runtime.
