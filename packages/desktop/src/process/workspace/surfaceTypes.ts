/**
 * Shared types for the **Workspace** feature — running several sub-agents in
 * parallel inside a single chat, each driving its own live "surface".
 *
 * A surface is one self-contained capability the user can see and the agent can
 * interact with:
 *
 * - `browser` — a live embedded browser tab (a {@link WebContentsView}) the
 *   sub-agent navigates/reads/clicks to research a page (e.g. "search jobs on
 *   site A").
 * - `editor`  — a file the sub-agent reads and rewrites through the fs bridge
 *   (e.g. "edit document B").
 *
 * The orchestrator (`workspaceOrchestrator.ts`) takes a list of {@link SurfaceSpec}s
 * and runs each on its own sub-agent **concurrently**, gated by the
 * ResourceCoordinator (`TaskKind: 'agent'`) so the machine never thrashes
 * (Requirement 5, criterion 3.12). Progress for every surface is streamed to the
 * renderer as {@link WorkspaceEvent}s so each frame shows its own live narration.
 *
 * This module is types-only (no runtime behaviour) so it can be imported by both
 * the Main-process orchestrator/bridge and — via `import type` — the renderer
 * page, without crossing the process boundary at runtime.
