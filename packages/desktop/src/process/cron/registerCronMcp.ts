/**
 * Start the in-process Cron MCP host and ensure the MCP catalog has an `sse`
 * server entry pointing at its loopback URL — so an agent (Claude Code / ACP,
 * tomnyagentic, …) can connect and manage the user's scheduled tasks as tools.
 *
 * Uses the bounded registration pattern shared by other built-in MCP hosts.
 * The catalog entry is created
 * `enabled: false` (not auto-attached to every new chat): it is opt-in per
 * conversation through the MCP picker / the "Super" capability surface. The
 * loopback port is ephemeral (changes each boot), so this registration is
 * idempotent: it finds the existing catalog entry by name and refreshes its URL,
 * or creates it the first time.
 *
 * Called once after the backend is ready (from `runBackendMigrations`). Failures
 * are swallowed/logged — a registration problem must never block boot, and the
 * UI plane (the Scheduled Tasks page) keeps working regardless.
 *
 * Process boundary: Main-process (Node.js) module — no DOM APIs.
