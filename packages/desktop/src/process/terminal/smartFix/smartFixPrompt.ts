/**
 * PURE helpers for the Smart Fix in-terminal confirmation prompt (auto-rerun).
 *
 * When auto-rerun is enabled and a failed command has a known remap, the
 * terminal prints a `(y/N)` question and waits for the next keystroke. Printing
 * the question into the terminal (rather than only showing a GUI button) makes
 * Smart Fix answerable by an AGENT driving the terminal via text — it reads the
 * question from the output stream and types `y`/`n`, exactly like a human.
 *
 * These helpers build the prompt line and classify the answer key. No I/O.

 * Classify a raw keystroke chunk while a `(y/N)` prompt is active:

 *  - `n` / `N` / Esc      → reject (dismiss)
 *  - anything else        → ignore (caller cancels the prompt + passes the key through)
 *
 * Enter is intentionally NOT a default-yes: a `(y/N)` prompt requires an explicit
 * `y`, so a stray Enter never auto-runs a substituted command.
