/**
 * `patchApplier` — the real, reversible {@link PatchApplier} for the patch gate
 * (Yêu cầu 6, criteria 6.5 / 6.7). It applies an APPROVED, sandbox-validated
 * unified diff to the app source tree and always captures a rollback snapshot
 * FIRST so the change can be reverted.
 *
 * SAFETY SCOPE — by design this does NOT hot-swap the running, packaged binary
 * (that needs a build/repackage step which is out of scope and unsafe to do
 * live). Instead it operates on a configured writable `targetRoot` (the app
 * source dir in development; a staged copy in production) and, before touching
 * any file, copies the original bytes of every file the diff edits into a
 * per-proposal snapshot dir under `snapshotRoot`. `restore` copies those bytes
 * back. The patch gate guarantees `apply` is only ever reached for a proposal
 * whose sandbox run PASSED and that cleared review (Property 8), so the file the
 * user accepted is exactly what was tested.
 *
 * The unified diff is applied with the `diff` package (already a dependency).
 * All fs access is injected so this module is unit-testable without real disk.
 *
 * Process boundary: Main-process (Node.js) module — no DOM APIs.
