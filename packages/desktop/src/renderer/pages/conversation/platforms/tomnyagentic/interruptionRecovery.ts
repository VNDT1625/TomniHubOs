/**
 * Pure decision logic for silently recovering an tomnyagentic conversation that was
 * interrupted *unintentionally* (network drop, provider/API-key error, backend
 * crash) before its turn finished.
 *
 * The renderer believes a turn is "running" while it sees stream activity. If
 * that activity stops without the turn completing normally, we cannot trust the
 * send/stop button state alone — the user might just be typing a new prompt. So
 * we determine liveness independently (was this a user stop? did the backend
 * report an error? is the backend still running?) and, when the stop was NOT
 * user-initiated, silently re-send a "continue" turn on the same conversation.
 *
 * This module is intentionally pure and deterministic (no timers, no I/O) so the
 * recovery policy can be unit-tested; the renderer hook drives it with real
 * clocks and the real stream / HTTP calls.
