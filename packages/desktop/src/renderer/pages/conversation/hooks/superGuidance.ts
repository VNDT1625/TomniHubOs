/**
 * Standing instructions injected into a conversation's rules layer when **Super**
 * is on (the Browser-Control MCP is attached).
 *
 * Why this exists: without explicit guidance the CLI agent (aionrs / Claude
 * Code, …) tends to "open a browser" by **spawning sub-agents that shell out to
 * the OS** (`start`/`open`/`cmd /c start`). On Windows that fails outright
 * ("Windows cannot find '\\'") and, worse, those sub-agents do not inherit the
 * conversation's Browser-Control tools, so they have no way to actually drive a
 * page. The result is the user-reported "sub-agent has no permission / stuck".
 *
 * These rules steer the agent to the embedded `browser_*` tools instead — which
 * open tabs *inside the app* that the user can watch live — and tell it to run
 * things "in parallel" by opening multiple tabs itself rather than spawning
 * sub-agents or running shell commands.
 *
 * Renderer-only module: a pure string builder, no side effects.
