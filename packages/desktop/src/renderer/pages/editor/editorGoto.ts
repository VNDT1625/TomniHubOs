/**
 * A tiny pub/sub for "reveal this file at line:col" requests, used to make
 * terminal `file:line:col` links jump to the right position in the editor.
 *
 * Wiring goto through the editor tab system as props is awkward because editors
 * are kept mounted per file path. Instead, the source (e.g. the terminal panel)
 * opens the file the normal way and then emits a goto request here; the Monaco
 * adapter already mounted for that path listens and reveals the position. A
 * short-lived buffer holds the last request so an editor that mounts *just
 * after* the request (first open) can still pick it up.
 *
 * Process boundary: Renderer module. No Node.js APIs.
