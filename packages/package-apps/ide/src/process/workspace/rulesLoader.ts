/**
 * `rulesLoader` — reads project governance rules from well-known files in a
 * repo root and returns them as a string array for the Context Builder.
 *
 * Supported files (checked in priority order, first found wins):
 *   1. `.tomnyrules`   — Omni-native rules file (Markdown, one rule per line or block)
 *   2. `AGENTS.md`    — Claude Code / Kiro convention (already used by this repo)
 *   3. `.cursorrules` — Cursor convention (many repos already have this)
 *
 * The content is split into non-empty lines and returned as individual rule
 * strings so the Context Builder can prepend them to the agent brief. Lines
 * starting with `#` (Markdown headings) are kept as section headers.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-injected (fs is injected) so it is unit-testable without
 * real disk. Silently returns `[]` when no rules file is found — the IDE Chat
 * still works, just without project-specific rules.
 *
 * Process boundary: Main-process (Node.js) module. No DOM APIs.
