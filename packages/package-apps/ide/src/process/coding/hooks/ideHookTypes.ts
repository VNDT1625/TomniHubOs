/**
 * Types for the IDE Agent Hooks feature — workspace automations that react to
 * IDE events (a file saved/created/deleted, or a manual trigger) by either
 * asking the IDE Chat agent a prompt or running a shell command.
 *
 * This mirrors the idea of Kiro's own agent hooks but lives INSIDE Tomny's
 * Studio › IDE, scoped per workspace folder. Definitions are persisted as JSON
 * so they survive restarts.
 *
 * Process boundary: shared type module — safe to import from both Main and
 * renderer (no Node/DOM APIs here).
