/**
 * `graphSnapshot` — the TIME dimension of the IDE knowledge graph.
 *
 * The structural graph ({@link KnowledgeGraph}) answers "what depends on what
 * RIGHT NOW". This module adds "what CHANGED between two points in time": given
 * an older snapshot and a newer one, {@link diffGraphs} reports the files and
 * relationships that were added / removed / changed.
 *
 * ## Role (deliberately narrow — avoid over-reach)
 *
 * This is a *localisation hint* for bug fixing, NOT a bug detector. When code
 * worked at commit A but breaks at commit B, the diff narrows the suspects:
 * "between A and B, file X changed and now imports Y". It does NOT decide what
 * is broken or why — git-bisect + tests find the breaking commit; the agent
 * reads the real code to decide the fix. The diff just stops the agent from
 * re-reading the whole repo.
 *
 * Pure + dependency-free (no fs, no git, no LLM) so it is trivially testable;
 * the bridge layer supplies the persisted snapshots and the git commit hash.
 *
 * Process boundary: shared module (Main builder imports it). No DOM/Node APIs.
