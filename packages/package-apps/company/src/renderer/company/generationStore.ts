/**
 * Background "design a company" store.
 *
 * Designing a company from a description is a long single model call. If the
 * work lived in a React component's state, switching tabs would unmount the
 * Company page and the user would lose the in-flight progress (it *looks* like
 * the generation stopped, even though the Main-process call keeps running).
 *
 * This module-level store decouples the task from any component: the generation
 * runs here, survives unmount/remount, and notifies subscribers. The Company
 * page (via {@link useCompanyState}) subscribes on mount and reads the current
 * state — so leaving and returning to the tab shows the live progress and the
 * final result, never a silent reset.
 *
 * Process boundary: Renderer module. No Node.js APIs — the actual work is the
 * injected `run` function (the company bridge call).
