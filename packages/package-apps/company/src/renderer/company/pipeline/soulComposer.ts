/**
 * Soul composer — turns a role node into the **soul/workflow** prompt that
 * drives it (spec `agent-company-pipeline`, Requirement 1).
 *
 * The core idea (per the user): the workflow is NOT hardcoded in engine code.
 * Each role acts according to its *soul* — a generic, role-type workflow
 * template, specialised with the role's AI-designed `responsibilities`, its
 * **direct children** (so it knows who it may delegate to), and the company
 * rules. The recursive engine simply feeds this soul to the model and lets it
 * decide how to act (delegate vs execute vs request approval/test). Different
 * companies therefore behave differently purely through their structure +
 * responsibilities + rules — no per-company code branches.
 *
 * Composing at runtime (rather than persisting a frozen soul) means editing a
 * role's `responsibilities` or the company `rules` in the UI changes the next
 * run automatically (Requirement 1.4), with no extra storage round-trip.
 *
 * Process boundary: Renderer module, PURE (no I/O). Only `import type` from
 * Main-process modules (erased at compile time).
