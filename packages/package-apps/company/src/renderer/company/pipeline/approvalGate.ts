/**
 * Approval gate — the boss's authority over the pipeline (Requirement 4).
 *
 * When a role's workflow asks to have a milestone approved (e.g. an architecture
 * document before work fans out) or to perform a sensitive action, the pipeline
 * pauses that branch and waits for a human/President decision. This module is a
 * small promise registry: `request(...)` returns a promise that stays pending
 * until `resolve(requestId, ...)` is called, which mirrors how the existing
 * `companyConversation` permission gate works — generalised to both
 * stage-approvals (with an artifact) and sensitive-action permissions.
 *
 * Process boundary: Renderer module. No Node.js APIs.
