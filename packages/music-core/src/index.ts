/**
 * @tomny/music-core — headless music engine.
 *
 * Pure TypeScript: schema, engine commands, scheduler/render, audio analysis
 * (the agent's "ears"), music theory, vocal-tune planning, producer brain, and
 * the agent tool catalog. No UI, no Web Audio, no Node-only APIs here, so it is
 * safe to import from both the renderer (UI plane) and the main process / MCP
 * (agent plane). Both planes are thin clients of this core.
 *
 * NOTE: the filesystem-backed project repo (node:fs) lives in the desktop
 * process layer, not here, to keep this package renderer-safe.
 *
 * Explicit re-exports are used where two modules share a name (`Scale`,
 * `pitchClassName` exist in both analysis/key and theory/theory). The theory
 * versions are canonical; key's are exported under aliases.
