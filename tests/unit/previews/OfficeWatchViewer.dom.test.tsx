 * N4c V8: OfficeWatchViewer export-shape smoke test.
 *
 * Design note:
 * OfficeWatchViewer mounts long-lived watch polling via useEffect. Rendering it
 * under jsdom (even with fully stubbed ipcBridge / Arco / WebviewHost) spins
 * setInterval/setTimeout cycles that don't settle inside worker-fork timeouts
 * and cause the vitest pool to hang (see plan §2.4 WS reconnect hazard).
 *
 * We therefore validate only the static module surface: exports, component
 * type, displayName-ish identity. Runtime render coverage for this file is
 * deferred to e2e (where the real watch backend is online) — this trade-off
 * is recorded in N4c-final.md Deviations.
 *
 * The module has a heavy dependency chain, so the cold import is paid ONCE in
 * `beforeAll` (with a generous hook timeout) rather than inside a per-test
 * timer, which under full-suite parallel transform pressure can exceed the
 * default 10s and cause a flaky timeout.
